# Project State

## Current Phase
Phase 4 — PolyBLEP Synth Voices + AHDSR + SVF Filter (`v0.4.0`)

## Build Status
- VST3: Builds successfully (Release)
- Standalone: Builds successfully (Release)
- Tests: 75/75 passing (pure C++, no JUCE dependency)

## Test Metrics
- Grid tests: 9 (basics, wrapping, age, copy, equality)
- GoL correctness: 10 (Blinker, Block, Beehive, Glider, generation, age, seeding, density)
- Rule variants: 4 (HighLife, Seeds, Ambient, toroidal)
- SPSC queue: 4 (push/pop, full, drain, bounded drain)
- Phase 2 mutation: 3 (birth rule flip, survival disabled, age reset)
- ScaleQuantizer: 5 (all 15 scales, 12 roots, out-of-scale check, MIDI clamp, pentatonic)
- Microtuning: 6 (12-TET, Just P5, Pythagorean, ref pitch, all systems A4, cents offset)
- ClockDivider: 5 (quarter at 120BPM, all divisions, swing, no-swing, buffer accuracy)
- Integration: 3 (clock drives GoL, quantizer+GoL, transport pause/resume)
- Phase 3 mutation: 3 (Dorian interval, Just P5 offset, clock comparator)
- Oscillator: 7 (sine accuracy, saw/square range, pulse symmetry, anti-aliasing, output range, frequency accuracy)
- Envelope: 5 (attack timing, hold/decay/sustain, release, note-off during attack, retrigger)
- Filter: 4 (LP response, HP response, resonance, stability at max Q)
- SynthVoice: 3 (full chain output, 8-voice polyphony, sub tracking)
- Phase 4 mutation: 4 (PolyBLEP presence, instant attack, cutoff offset, sub octave division)
